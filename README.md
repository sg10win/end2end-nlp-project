# Streamlit Sentiment Analyzer

This project is an attempt to build a website where anyone can enter a sentence and receive as output the feelings expressed by that sentence. The goal is to predict the emotions a person feels based on what they type.

## Features

1. **Web Interface**
   - Built using the Streamlit library to provide a simple and interactive web interface for users.

2. **Prediction Model**
   - Uses `CountVectorizer` and a `Logistic Regression` model to predict the feelings expressed in sentences.

## How It Works
- Enter a sentence into the provided text box on the website.
- The program processes the input and predicts the feelings based on the trained logistic regression model.

This project demonstrates the power of natural language processing (NLP) combined with machine learning to provide real-time emotion analysis in a user-friendly way.
